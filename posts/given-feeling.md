A feeling of aggravation. Sometimes, it’s glowing embers, ready to burn at any moment. But most of all, it’s a progression of an explosive result, a building pressure that can’t be relieved, until it’s a fuse is triggered. 

I’m angry, and it hurts to feel that way. It’s an oppressive emotion, one that bears down on me, sometimes simmering, but never allowing me to fully escape from its grasp. Partly, it’s because of my bitterness and envy from the darkest parts of my mind, paranoid of what is happening and what is to happen. 

Regret. It’s an even worse cause of anger. It is an emotional weight that never allows itself to be forgotten, and I feel neverending guilt. There are infinite possibilities, so many better paths I could’ve taken. Yet my basic desires without consideration blind me from ever looking past the past, looking through the future, looking, actually, looking...

Fairness. It doesn’t exist. As long as peoples’ perspectives remain distinct, as long as context is not universal, fairness is impossible. Everyone, notwithstanding myself, is too quick to qualify! Whether I had intention or not, I’m approached with the assumption of guilt. I stay silent, I must, because every word, it’s placement and choice, and every sound, it’s tone and accent, is unfairly taken as a representation of myself. An indirect assumption I make, let it be, and I’m immediately accused. 

Yet, with all of these emotions, life is still valuable. My existence as a human. I have an unwavering commitment to survive, even with the pain I feel. Is it family? Possibly. Knowing that while I would consciously not exist after death, but that I would have to feel the overwhelming guilt of taking something that is not mine prevents me such. Is it friends? Possibly. Knowing that there are still people who appreciate, even though not connected by blood and only by a delicate, emotional bond that exists because of the chance of our lives living as neighbors, gives me a crutch.

I don’t ever question that decision. It’s final, and I know it is. I value feeling, to extreme, the diversity. But why is that value necessitating pain?
