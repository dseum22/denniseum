As I reflect on how I’ve changed throughout my life, I’m unsure if I’ve truly become better. Overall, I view my life in terms of my three phases of age and education: elementary school, middle school, and high school. 

I want to begin by defining what “better” means to me. I believe the quality of myself is split into two parts, first being my ethics in my interactions. Especially in understanding my role to support the community as a whole and in being empathetic, it is undeniable I have improved, closely correlated with my maturity through time. I am more conscious of what is right and wrong, and am able to be in control of myself, specifically the correct decision. 

However, the other part of my quality, my sheer willpower, has severely diminished. At a young age, I conceptually did not know what procrastination was. So unknown it was that I didn’t procrastinate. There was an order to my life in which I naturally prioritized my primary goals. But because this ability was a product of unconscious determination, it was my downfall as I became more conscious with age. More consciousness of myself gave me more direct control. But this meant my natural tendencies no longer applied; I had to consciously decide what activity in the moment was more important to me.

What’s worse is that around that time, my middle school years, I received my first phone. While I did resist social media for a few years, electronic devices made diversion from my true goals almost intuitive. If I’m struggling on an idea, it’s so simple to pull out my phone and swipe around, check messages, maybe play a “quick” match of a game (soon turning into multiple). Writing a complex essay, after one sentence, it is easy to think that that was a lot of work, then check social media or research unnecessary topics. 

This frustrates me. I remember my elementary and middle school years, and they were extremely enjoyable because I was determined and working to my goals. My perspective of what is relaxing and gives me a break has changed significantly now, which further incentivizes me to procrastinate. I used to enjoy the frenzy of figuring out a challenge or the chaos of being productive and efficient. Now, I feel lazy and even “relaxing” doesn’t feel good. Nothing does feel good in an unproductive state.
