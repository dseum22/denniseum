Jealousy. It’s an emotion that I’m all too familiar with, even though I detest it, because it’s so easy to view what others have and wish I had the same. This mindset, as a low-income student, is so much more difficult to avoid because there is a distinguishable socioeconomic division. Considering I go to a private school (under financial aid), I am surrounded constantly by success in which it becomes almost natural to blame my comparative lack of wealth.

In an honest overview, the root cause of my envy is my acknowledgment that I hadn’t been entirely productive. I shouldn’t have browsed social media. I shouldn’t have coded unimportant programs. I should’ve been working towards my key goals. This is constantly in my thoughts, and it’s almost a paradox: the underlying understanding is that I could have done so much more, yet my lack of determination and discipline prevented me from doing so. But because this critiques a personal aspect that I have full control over, it is much easier to criticize an uncontrollable factor.

Furthermore, I know that my “low-income” status here is still a privilege relative to many other students. My caring parents focused heavily on my education to give me the best experience possible. We have enough wealth to be financially stable. And the fact that this is true, in combination that I could have made better decisions with my time, really strikes me deep. 

In fact, I’m trying to use this blog to distill my thoughts so I can be clearer to myself. Through this, I hope I can be more open emotionally rather than constantly be weighed down by doubts.
