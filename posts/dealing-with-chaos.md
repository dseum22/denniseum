As I grow older, it seems like I face failure more and more every day. While I don't truly understand why, I hypothesize two causes. First, I'm becoming more "aware" of details, which increases the opportunities I have to judge myself. Second, the activities I do instinctively mean more to me, and, unfortunately, a loss hurts me more.

I'm lucky that my parents taught me to alleviate the chaos of my emotions through expressing myself musically or athletically. I don't know where I would be without these moments. The sudden absence of emotions allows me to think clearly, free from the inner-judgement that often constantly fuels me to progress, but weakly because of the bitterness.

Indulged and privileged, I want to be the main character. Every failure contradicts my understanding of what a meaningful life is. This is not to say I strive to be perfect. I know that there is always a person in the world who achieves the life I crave. Whether this is due to environment I grow in or my personal incompetence and mediocre discipline, I don't know. But that doesn't matter anyways. 

What's really important is that there is never a main character. Billions of individual lives, and to each perspective, the self is the true story, the one that never lies and pushes through. Whether facing failure or success, there is the will to be the genuine individual. But, at some point, I lost that will. I no longer feel like the main character in my own story. Through my own perspective, I reject myself and all personal contribution.

What do I represent in my life? After first acknowledging this about myself, I can only describe it vaguely musically. A lone, minor key voice of the cello that weaves between the different ranges of profound emotion. A despairing but paradoxically triumphant sound that silently strikes the listener, who lacks. Vibrato brings nuance to the emotion, a quivering touch that blesses the fragility of the tone.
